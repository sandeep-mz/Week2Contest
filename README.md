# Weekly Contest Report - Library system  Webpage
# Introduction
This repository contains my implementation of an interactive web page for a basic library system, as part of an assignment. The webpage includes a sticky navigation bar, a table of books, and a registration form.

# Task Description
The project tasks were as follows:
- Design and implement a sticky navigation bar with "Books" and "Register" links.
- Create a table displaying book information with nested details.
- Design a registration form with specific input fields and validation.

# HTML Structure
The HTML structure of the project consists of the following main components:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that lays out the structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the webpage components.

# User Interface
I focused on creating a clean and user-friendly interface for the webpage:
- Designed a sticky navigation bar with appealing colors and typography.
- Styled the book table with alternating row colors and nested details for each book.
- Created a registration form with a modern layout and required input fields.

# Challenges Overcome
During the project, I encountered a few challenges:
- Implementing smooth scrolling from the navigation bar to specific sections.
- Ensuring proper alignment of nested table content within the book table.
- Validating the age input field to meet the assignment's requirements.

I overcame these challenges by researching and experimenting with different solutions until achieving the desired outcomes.

# Lessons Learned
This project taught me several valuable lessons, including:
- Enhanced my understanding of HTML and CSS for creating interactive web pages.
- Practiced implementing smooth scrolling and styling nested tables.
- Gained experience in form validation and input type attributes.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, I am pleased with the outcome of the project. It allowed me to apply and expand my web development skills while creating an engaging and functional library system webpage. I am submitting this project as part of my assignment and look forward to further feedback.
